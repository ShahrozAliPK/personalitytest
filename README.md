<h1>What inspire me?</h1>
<p>I didn't come up with this project if my sister didn't told me about this.She was given a task to complete a quiz of her BBA which was a quiz based upon your personality test.When I come to know about this quiz, I decided to implement it in the form of a program to practice my C language skills and get more experience regarding algorithms, data structures and computational logic.And finally, after several weeks I am done with this program.</p>
